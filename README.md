## Note to current COS 126 students

If you are currently enrolled in COS 126 and want to copy my code, a friendly reminder that academic integrity is a thing. That said, if you can refactor Javascript/HTML into the course's Java environment, you are more than capable of - and would likely save time by - simply doing the assignment yourself.
