            <p><span class="bold">This page contains a Javascript/HTML reimplementation of NBody, a classic Java programming assignment from COS 126 (Princeton's flagship intro CS course)</span>. The original assignment tasks the student with writing a Java program to simulate the motion of N bodies in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces (an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation" target="_blank">N-body simulation</a>), and animate the results using instructor-provided APIs.</p>

            <p>The assignment itself is quite simple, containing a handful of nested for-loops for performing physics calculations and roughly 100 total lines of Java code. <span class="bold">Its notoriety arises from the fact that students were expected to churn it out within the third week of the course, with many students having zero prior coding experience</span>. Thus, for perhaps <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/students-reflect-cos-126-one-most-popular-university-courses" target="_blank">the majority</a> of Princeton undergraduates, the joy upon successfully managing to render a solar system that does NOT flicker, drift away, or throw a myriad of errors to the console, all to the tune of an appropriately crude MIDI rendition of "Also sprach Zarathustra," has strangely become a defining moment of their undergraduate experience.</p>

            <p>Source code on <a href="https://github.com/dsshen/NBody-JS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you are currently enrolled in COS 126 and want to copy my code, a friendly reminder that academic integrity is a thing. That said, if you can refactor Javascript/HTML into the course's Java environment, you are more than capable of - and would likely save time by - simply doing the assignment yourself.</p>
